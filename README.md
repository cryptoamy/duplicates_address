The original GitHub report forgot to deduplicate with the initial list. Here, I'm adding a list of addresses that need to be removed from my Sybil list. There are a total of 2519 addresses. Because the L0 Team emphasized that the original report's list cannot be modified, I'm providing a supplementary list here of addresses that need to be removed. The final list is obtained by removing [ duplicates_with_initial_list.csv](https://github.com/cryptoamy/duplicates_address/blob/main/duplicates_with_inital_list.csv) from [layerzero_sybil_scan_report](https://github.com/cryptoamy/layerzero_sybil_scan_report/blob/main/layerzero_sybil_node_final.csv).
